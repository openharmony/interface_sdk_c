 /*
  * IMPORTANT: When updating version, the following things need to be done:
  * source/common/unicode/uvernum.h - this file: update major, minor,
  *        patchlevel, suffix, version, short version constants, namespace,
  *                    renaming macro, and copyright
  *
  * The following files need to be updated as well, which can be done
  *  by running the UNIX makefile target 'update-windows-makefiles' in icu4c/source.
  *
  * source/allinone/Build.Windows.IcuVersion.props - Update the IcuMajorVersion
  * source/data/makedata.mak - change U_ICUDATA_NAME so that it contains
  *                            the new major/minor combination, and UNICODE_VERSION
  *                            for the Unicode version.
