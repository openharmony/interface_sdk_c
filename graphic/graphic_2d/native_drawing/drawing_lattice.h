 *
 * @param xDivs Array of X coordinates used to divide the image. The value is an integer.
 * @param yDivs Array of Y coordinates used to divide the image. The value is an integer.
 * @param xCount Size of the array that holds the X coordinates. The value range is [0, 5].
 * @param yCount Size of the array that holds the Y coordinates. The value range is [0, 5].
 * @param bounds The original bounding rectangle to be drawn, which defaults to the size of the original image
 * rectangle. The value must be an integer and is rounded down.
 * @param rectTypes Array of rectangle types used to fill the lattice.
 * @param rectTypeCount Size of the **rectTypes** array. If **rectTypes** is not a null pointer, the array size must be
 * **(xCount + 1)*(yCount + 1)**.
 * If **rectTypes** is a null pointer, the array size must be **0**.
 * @param colors Array of colors used to fill the lattice.
 * @param colorCount Size of the **colors** array. If **colors** is not a null pointer, the array size must be **(
 * xCount + 1)*(yCount + 1)**.
 * If **colors** is a null pointer, the array size must be **0**.
 * @param lattice Double pointer to an {@link OH_Drawing_Lattice} object, which serves as an output parameter returned
 * to the caller.
 * @return Execution result.
 * Returns **OH_DRAWING_SUCCESS** if the operation is successful.
 * Returns **OH_DRAWING_ERROR_INCORRECT_PARAMETER** for any of the following reasons:
 * - **xDivs** or **yDivs** is a null pointer.
 * - **rectTypes** is not a null pointer, and **rectTypeCount** is not equal to **(xCount + 1)*(yCount + 1)**.
 * - **colors** is not a null pointer, and **colorCount** is not equal to **(xCount + 1)*(yCount + 1)**.
 * - **rectTypes** is a null pointer, and **rectTypeCount** is not equal to **0**.
 * - **colors** is a null pointer, and **colorCount** is not equal to **0**.
 * Returns **OH_DRAWING_ERROR_PARAMETER_OUT_OF_RANGE**, indicating that the enumeration value in **rectTypes** exceeds
